               I have recently trained as a web-developer through a bootcamp at HyperionDev. During this course I have learned many skills including how to build this 
               react app CV. The languages and techniques I learnt include: JavaScript, JSX, Node.JS, React.JS, Redux, MongoDB, Express, HTML, JSON, AJAX, CSS. using these I can create any front end design 
               required. 
               <br></br>
               <br></br>
               I have always had a great passion for tech but only recently decided to push this into a possible professional carreer. I have greatly enjoyed learing how to do all 
               aspects of front end development and I have now started learning Python so deepen my skills and understanding,
               <br></br>
               <br></br>
               I have no current professional tech experience but a wealth of other business skills and I hope to move my career in a more tech direction.
